    <h1>Information Overload</h1>
    
        Information overload is the difficulty in understanding an issue and effectively making decisions when one has too 
        much information about that issue. Generally, the term is associated with the excessive quantity of daily information. 
        The term was popularized by Alvin Toffler in his bestselling 1970 book Future Shock.
        
        Information overload is one of the primary motivations for developing information retrieval systems. Search engines, 
        recommender systems, and filtering tools are all designed to help users navigate the vast amount of information 
        available, particularly on the internet. Techniques for dealing with information overload include better search 
        algorithms, personalization, collaborative filtering, and information visualization. As the amount of digital 
        information continues to grow exponentially, managing information overload remains a critical challenge.

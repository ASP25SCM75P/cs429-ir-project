    <h1>Personalized Search</h1>
    
        Personalized search refers to web search experiences that are tailored specifically to an individual's interests by incorporating 
        information about the individual beyond the specific query provided. Search engines can personalize results based on factors like 
        search history, location, preferences, and social connections.
        
        While personalization can improve search quality by providing more relevant results, it also raises privacy concerns and can create 
        filter bubbles where users are primarily exposed to information that confirms their existing views. Personalization techniques include 
        user profiling, collaborative filtering, and contextual factors. Major search engines like Google provide personalized results by 
        default, though users can opt out or use incognito mode. Balancing personalization benefits with privacy and diversity concerns 
        remains an ongoing challenge in information retrieval.

    <h1>Document Classification</h1>
    
        Document classification or document categorization is a problem in library science, information science 
        and computer science. The task is to assign a document to one or more classes or categories. This may 
        be done manually or algorithmically. The intellectual classification of documents has mostly been the 
        province of library science, while the algorithmic classification of documents is mainly in information 
        science and computer science.
        
        The classification task is supervised learning; categories are known beforehand and documents are 
        classified into these predefined categories. This is in contrast to document clustering, which is 
        unsupervised learning. Modern approaches use machine learning methods including support vector machines, 
        neural networks, and deep learning.

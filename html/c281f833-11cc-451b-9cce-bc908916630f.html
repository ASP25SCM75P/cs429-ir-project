    <h1>Search Engine</h1>
    
        A search engine is a software system designed to carry out web searches. They search the World Wide 
        Web in a systematic way for particular information specified in a textual web search query. The 
        search results are generally presented in a line of results, often referred to as search engine 
        results pages (SERPs).
        
        When a user enters a query into a search engine, the engine examines its index and provides a listing 
        of best-matching web pages according to its criteria, usually with a short summary containing the 
        document's title and sometimes parts of the text. Most search engines support the use of the boolean 
        operators AND, OR and NOT to help end users refine the search query.

    <h1>Real-Time Search</h1>
    
        Real-time search enables users to find the most recent information as events unfold. This is particularly important for news, social 
        media, and other rapidly updated content. Real-time search goes beyond traditional web crawling, which may take days or weeks to discover 
        and index new content.
        
        Social media platforms like Twitter pioneered real-time search, allowing users to find tweets about current events within seconds of 
        posting. Search engines have incorporated real-time features through news sections and specialized indexing of frequently updated sources. 
        Technical challenges include incremental indexing, handling high update rates, and determining result freshness. Streaming data processing 
        frameworks enable real-time analysis of new content. Real-time search systems must balance freshness with relevance and quality. The 
        recency ranking factor gives newer documents higher weight when appropriate. Real-time search is essential for applications like emergency 
        response, financial markets, and trend detection.

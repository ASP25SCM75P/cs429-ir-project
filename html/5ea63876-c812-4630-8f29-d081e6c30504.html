    <h1>Question Answering</h1>
    
        Question answering (QA) is a computer science discipline within the fields of information retrieval and natural language 
        processing (NLP) which is concerned with building systems that automatically answer questions posed by humans in a natural 
        language. A QA system is a type of information retrieval system.
        
        Question answering systems can be classified as either open-domain, which attempt to answer questions about nearly anything, 
        or closed-domain, which focus on a specific domain. Modern QA systems use techniques from information retrieval, natural 
        language processing, and machine learning. They typically involve question analysis, document retrieval, answer extraction, 
        and answer validation. Recent advances using transformers like BERT have significantly improved QA performance. Virtual 
        assistants like Siri, Alexa, and Google Assistant incorporate QA capabilities.

    <h1>BM25</h1>
    
        BM25 is a ranking function used by search engines to estimate the relevance of documents to a given search 
        query. It is based on the probabilistic retrieval framework developed in the 1970s and 1980s by Stephen E. 
        Robertson, Karen Spärck Jones, and others.
        
        The name of the actual ranking function is BM25. The abbreviation BM stands for Best Matching. It is a 
        bag-of-words retrieval function that ranks a set of documents based on the query terms appearing in each 
        document, regardless of their proximity within the document. BM25 is widely used in modern search engines 
        and is considered one of the most effective ranking functions for information retrieval.

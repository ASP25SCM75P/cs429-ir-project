    <h1>Multimedia Information Retrieval</h1>
    
        Multimedia information retrieval extends traditional text-based IR to handle images, audio, video, and other media types. This field 
        addresses the challenges of searching, browsing, and organizing multimedia content. As multimedia content on the web continues to grow, 
        effective multimedia IR becomes increasingly important.
        
        Content-based image retrieval (CBIR) systems search images based on visual features like color, texture, and shape. Video retrieval 
        systems may use shot detection, keyframe extraction, and audio analysis. Music information retrieval systems can search by melody, 
        rhythm, or lyrics. Modern approaches use deep learning to extract high-level semantic features from multimedia content. Multimodal 
        retrieval systems can search across different media types, for example, finding videos relevant to a text query. Multimedia IR also 
        involves challenges in metadata extraction, similarity measurement, and result presentation.

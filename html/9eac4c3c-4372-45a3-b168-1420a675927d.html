    <h1>N-gram</h1>
    
        In the fields of computational linguistics and probability, an n-gram is a contiguous sequence of n items 
        from a given sample of text or speech. The items can be phonemes, syllables, letters, words or base pairs 
        according to the application. The n-grams typically are collected from a text or speech corpus.
        
        An n-gram of size 1 is referred to as a 'unigram'; size 2 is a 'bigram'; size 3 is a 'trigram'. Larger 
        sizes are sometimes referred to by the value of n in modern language, e.g., 'four-gram', 'five-gram', and 
        so on. In information retrieval, n-grams are useful for capturing phrases and multi-word expressions that 
        might be lost if only individual words are indexed.

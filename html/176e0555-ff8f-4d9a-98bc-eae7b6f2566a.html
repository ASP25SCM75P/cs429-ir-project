    <h1>Query Processing</h1>
    
        Query processing in information retrieval is the process of deciding which documents in a collection should be 
        retrieved for a user query. The process involves query parsing, query transformation, document matching, and 
        result ranking. Modern search engines must process queries efficiently even with very large document collections.
        
        Query processing typically begins with query parsing where the user's input is analyzed and potentially transformed. 
        This may involve spell checking, stemming, stop word removal, and query expansion. The transformed query is then 
        matched against the index to identify candidate documents. Finally, a ranking function scores and orders the results. 
        Optimization techniques like caching, index compression, and parallel processing are crucial for handling the scale 
        of modern web search.

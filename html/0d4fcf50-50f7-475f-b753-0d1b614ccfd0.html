    <h1>Entity Linking</h1>
    
        Entity linking, also called named entity disambiguation or named entity normalization, is the task of determining the 
        identity of entities mentioned in text. For example, the word 'Paris' could refer to the city in France, the city in 
        Texas, or Paris Hilton. Entity linking systems disambiguate such mentions by linking them to entries in a knowledge base.
        
        Entity linking is important for semantic search and information retrieval because it helps systems understand what documents 
        are about beyond simple keyword matching. Knowledge graphs like Wikipedia, DBpedia, and Wikidata serve as common targets 
        for entity linking. Modern entity linking systems use machine learning and consider features like context, entity popularity, 
        and string similarity. Once entities are linked, they enable more sophisticated retrieval operations like finding all 
        documents about a particular person, place, or organization regardless of how they're named in the text.

    <h1>Word Embedding</h1>
    
        In natural language processing, word embedding is a term used for the representation of words for text analysis, 
        typically in the form of a real-valued vector that encodes the meaning of the word such that the words that are 
        closer in the vector space are expected to be similar in meaning.
        
        Word embeddings can be obtained using a set of language modeling and feature learning techniques where words or 
        phrases from the vocabulary are mapped to vectors of real numbers. Methods include neural networks, dimensionality 
        reduction on the word co-occurrence matrix, and probabilistic models. Popular models include Word2Vec, GloVe, and 
        FastText. These representations have become fundamental in modern NLP and information retrieval systems.

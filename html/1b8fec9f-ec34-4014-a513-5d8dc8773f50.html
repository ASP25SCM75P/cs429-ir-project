    <h1>Ranking Function</h1>
    
        Ranking of query results is an important operation in information retrieval. When a query is submitted, the search 
        engine returns a list of documents in order of relevance to that query. The goal of ranking is to present the most 
        relevant documents first, minimizing the user's effort in finding what they need.
        
        Various ranking functions have been developed over the years. Classic methods include TF-IDF and BM25. Modern search 
        engines use machine learning approaches including learning to rank, neural networks, and ensemble methods. Factors 
        considered in ranking may include term frequency, document frequency, document length normalization, proximity of 
        query terms, PageRank, click-through rates, and many others. The effectiveness of a ranking function is typically 
        measured using metrics like precision, recall, and mean average precision.

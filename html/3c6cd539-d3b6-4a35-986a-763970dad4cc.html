    <h1>Machine Learning in IR</h1>
    
        Machine learning has become increasingly important in information retrieval. Machine learning is a method of data 
        analysis that automates analytical model building. It is a branch of artificial intelligence based on the idea that 
        systems can learn from data, identify patterns and make decisions with minimal human intervention.
        
        In information retrieval, machine learning is used for tasks including ranking, query understanding, spam detection, 
        personalization, and relevance feedback. Learning to rank is a particularly important application where machine 
        learning models are trained to optimize ranking functions. Features used in these models may include term frequencies, 
        click-through rates, document quality signals, and many others. Modern search engines rely heavily on machine learning 
        to improve search quality and user experience.

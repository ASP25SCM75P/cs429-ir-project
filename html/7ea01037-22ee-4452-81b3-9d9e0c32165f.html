    <h1>Natural Language Processing</h1>
    
        Natural language processing (NLP) is an interdisciplinary subfield of computer science and linguistics. 
        It is primarily concerned with giving computers the ability to support and manipulate human language. 
        It involves processing natural language datasets, such as text corpora or speech corpora, using either 
        rule-based or probabilistic machine learning approaches.
        
        The goal is a computer capable of understanding the contents of documents, including the contextual 
        nuances of the language within them. NLP has many applications including machine translation, sentiment 
        analysis, question answering, and information retrieval. Modern NLP techniques are based on machine 
        learning, especially statistical machine learning.

    <h1>Elasticsearch</h1>
    
        Elasticsearch is a search engine based on the Lucene library. It provides a distributed, multitenant-capable 
        full-text search engine with an HTTP web interface and schema-free JSON documents. Elasticsearch is developed 
        in Java and is released as open source.
        
        Elasticsearch is commonly used for log analytics, full-text search, security intelligence, business analytics, 
        and operational intelligence use cases. It provides real-time search and analytics for all types of data. 
        Whether you have structured or unstructured text, numerical data, or geospatial data, Elasticsearch can 
        efficiently store and index it in a way that supports fast searches. The ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, 
        Kibana) is a popular combination for log management and analytics.

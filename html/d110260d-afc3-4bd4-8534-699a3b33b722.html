    <h1>Precision and Recall</h1>
    
        In pattern recognition, information retrieval and classification, precision is the fraction of relevant 
        instances among the retrieved instances, while recall is the fraction of relevant instances that were 
        retrieved. Both precision and recall are therefore based on relevance.
        
        Precision can be seen as a measure of quality, and recall as a measure of quantity. Higher precision 
        means that an algorithm returns more relevant results than irrelevant ones. Higher recall means that an 
        algorithm returns most of the relevant results. In information retrieval contexts, precision and recall 
        are used to evaluate the performance of search engines and other retrieval systems.

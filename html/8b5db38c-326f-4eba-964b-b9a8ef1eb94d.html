    <h1>Cross-Language Information Retrieval</h1>
    
        Cross-language information retrieval (CLIR) is a subfield of information retrieval dealing with retrieving information 
        written in a language different from the language of the user's query. For example, a user might submit a query in 
        English to search for documents in French, German, or Japanese.
        
        CLIR systems must address the challenge of matching concepts across languages. Approaches include query translation, 
        document translation, and using interlingual representations. Machine translation systems, bilingual dictionaries, and 
        parallel corpora are key resources. Modern approaches leverage neural machine translation and multilingual word embeddings. 
        CLIR is increasingly important as the web becomes more multilingual and users need access to information regardless of 
        language barriers.

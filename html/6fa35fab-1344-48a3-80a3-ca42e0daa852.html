    <h1>Privacy in Information Retrieval</h1>
    
        Privacy is an important concern in information retrieval systems. Search queries can reveal sensitive information about users' 
        interests, health conditions, political views, and personal situations. Search engines collect vast amounts of data about search 
        behavior, which raises privacy concerns even as it enables personalization and service improvements.
        
        Privacy-preserving IR techniques include anonymous search, encrypted search, and differential privacy. Private information retrieval 
        (PIR) protocols allow users to retrieve information from databases without revealing what they accessed. However, truly private search 
        often comes at the cost of reduced functionality or performance. Regulations like GDPR have increased attention to privacy in IR systems. 
        Search engines now provide controls for viewing and deleting search history. Balancing the benefits of data collection for service 
        improvement against user privacy remains a fundamental challenge in information retrieval.

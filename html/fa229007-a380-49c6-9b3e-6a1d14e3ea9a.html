    <h1>Bag of Words Model</h1>
    
        The bag-of-words model is a simplifying representation used in natural language processing and information 
        retrieval. In this model, a text is represented as the bag (multiset) of its words, disregarding grammar 
        and even word order but keeping multiplicity.
        
        The bag-of-words model is commonly used in methods of document classification where the occurrence of each 
        word is used as a feature for training a classifier. An example of the bag-of-words model is used in spam 
        filtering. The model has been used in computer vision as well. The bag-of-words model is one of the foundational 
        concepts in information retrieval and forms the basis for many modern search and classification techniques.

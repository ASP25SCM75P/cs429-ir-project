    <h1>Distributed Information Retrieval</h1>
    
        Distributed information retrieval involves searching across multiple independent search engines or document collections. 
        This is necessary when documents are distributed across multiple sites or when a single collection is too large to be 
        handled by one system. The web itself is inherently a distributed information space.
        
        Key challenges in distributed IR include resource selection (choosing which collections to search), query routing, and 
        result merging. Federated search systems search multiple sources simultaneously and combine results. Modern search engines 
        like Google and Bing use distributed architectures with thousands of servers to handle indexing and query processing at 
        web scale. MapReduce and similar frameworks enable parallel processing of large-scale IR tasks. Cloud computing platforms 
        provide infrastructure for building distributed IR systems.

    <h1>Cosine Similarity</h1>
    
        Cosine similarity is a measure of similarity between two non-zero vectors of an inner product space. 
        It is defined to equal the cosine of the angle between them, which is also the same as the inner 
        product of the same vectors normalized to both have length 1.
        
        The cosine similarity is particularly used in positive space, where the outcome is neatly bounded in 
        [0,1]. The cosine of 0° is 1, and it is less than 1 for any angle in the interval (0,π] radians. It 
        is thus a judgment of orientation and not magnitude. In the case of information retrieval, the cosine 
        similarity of two documents will range from 0 to 1, since the term frequencies cannot be negative.

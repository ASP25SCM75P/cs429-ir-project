    <h1>Digital Library</h1>
    
        A digital library is an online database of digital objects that can include text, still images, audio, video, digital 
        documents, or other digital media formats. Objects can consist of digitized content like print or photographs, as well 
        as originally produced digital content like word processor files or social media posts.
        
        Digital libraries provide access to information resources and services through the Internet. They support information 
        retrieval through search interfaces and browsing capabilities. Key challenges include metadata creation, preservation, 
        copyright management, and ensuring long-term access. Major digital libraries include Google Books, Internet Archive, 
        Project Gutenberg, and institutional repositories. Information retrieval techniques are essential for making digital 
        library collections accessible and useful.

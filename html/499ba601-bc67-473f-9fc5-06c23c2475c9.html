    <h1>Stop Words</h1>
    
        In computing, stop words are words which are filtered out before or after processing of natural language 
        data. There is no single universal list of stop words used by all natural language processing tools, and 
        indeed not all tools even use such a list.
        
        Some tools specifically avoid removing stop words to support phrase search. Any group of words can be chosen 
        as the stop words for a given purpose. For some search engines, these are some of the most common, short 
        function words, such as 'the', 'is', 'at', 'which', and 'on'. In this case, stop words can cause problems 
        when searching for phrases that include them. However, most modern information retrieval systems have evolved 
        to handle stop words more intelligently.

    <h1>Query Expansion</h1>
    
        Query expansion (QE) is the process of reformulating a seed query to improve retrieval performance in 
        information retrieval operations. In the context of web search engines, query expansion involves 
        evaluating a user's input and expanding the search query to match additional documents.
        
        Query expansion involves techniques like finding synonyms of words, and analyzing word frequencies and 
        patterns. Automatic query expansion is a method for improving recall in information retrieval. The goal 
        is to increase the number of relevant documents retrieved while ideally not retrieving more irrelevant 
        documents. Methods include relevance feedback, pseudo-relevance feedback, and using thesauri like WordNet.

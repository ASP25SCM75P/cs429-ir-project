    <h1>Document Clustering</h1>
    
        Document clustering is a technique for organizing a collection of documents into meaningful groups, or clusters, such 
        that documents within a cluster are more similar to each other than to documents in other clusters. This is a form of 
        unsupervised learning since the clusters are not predefined.
        
        Document clustering has applications in organizing search results, detecting topics in a collection, and improving 
        search efficiency. Common algorithms include k-means, hierarchical clustering, and density-based methods. The similarity 
        between documents is typically measured using cosine similarity on TF-IDF vectors or other document representations. 
        Document clustering can help users explore large document collections and discover relationships between documents that 
        might not be obvious from keyword search alone.

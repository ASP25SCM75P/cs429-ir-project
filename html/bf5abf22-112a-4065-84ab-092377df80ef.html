    <h1>Latent Semantic Analysis</h1>
    
        Latent semantic analysis (LSA) is a technique in natural language processing, in particular distributional 
        semantics, of analyzing relationships between a set of documents and the terms they contain by producing a 
        set of concepts related to the documents and terms.
        
        LSA assumes that words that are close in meaning will occur in similar pieces of text. A matrix containing 
        word counts per document is constructed from a large piece of text and a mathematical technique called 
        singular value decomposition (SVD) is used to reduce the number of rows while preserving the similarity 
        structure among columns. Documents are then compared by taking the cosine of the angle between the two vectors.

    <h1>Inverted Index</h1>
    
        In computer science, an inverted index is a database index storing a mapping from content, such as 
        words or numbers, to its locations in a table, or in a document or a set of documents. The purpose 
        of an inverted index is to allow fast full-text searches, at a cost of increased processing when a 
        document is added to the database.
        
        The inverted index data structure is a central component of a typical search engine indexing algorithm. 
        A goal of a search engine implementation is to optimize the speed of the query: find the documents 
        where word X occurs. Once a forward index is developed, which stores lists of words per document, 
        it is next inverted to develop an inverted index.

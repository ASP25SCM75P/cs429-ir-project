    <h1>Vector Space Model</h1>
    
        Vector space model or term vector model is an algebraic model for representing text documents as 
        vectors of identifiers, such as index terms. It is used in information filtering, information 
        retrieval, indexing and relevancy rankings. Its first use was in the SMART Information Retrieval 
        System.
        
        Documents and queries are represented as vectors. Each dimension corresponds to a separate term. 
        If a term occurs in the document, its value in the vector is non-zero. Several different ways of 
        computing these values, also known as term weights, have been developed. One of the best known 
        schemes is tf-idf weighting.

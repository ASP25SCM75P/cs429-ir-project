    <h1>Relevance Feedback</h1>
    
        Relevance feedback is a feature of some information retrieval systems. The idea behind relevance feedback 
        is to take the results that are initially returned from a given query and to use information about whether 
        or not those results are relevant to perform a new query.
        
        The user gives feedback on the relevance of documents in an initial set of results. The basic procedure is 
        to start with an initial query, retrieve documents, have the user mark documents as relevant or not relevant, 
        and then modify the query and repeat. Relevance feedback is most useful in systems where the user is unsure 
        of what they are looking for or how to express their information need.

    <h1>Index Term</h1>
    
        An index term, subject term, subject heading, or descriptor, in information retrieval, is a term that captures the 
        essence of the topic of a document. Index terms make up a controlled vocabulary for use in bibliographic records. 
        They are an integral part of bibliographic control, which is the function by which libraries collect, organize and 
        disseminate documents.
        
        Index terms are often referred to as keywords, tags, descriptive metadata, taxonomies, controlled vocabularies and 
        thesauri. In information retrieval systems, index terms are extracted from documents or assigned by human indexers. 
        The choice of index terms significantly affects retrieval effectiveness. Automatic indexing methods extract terms 
        based on statistical properties of the text, while manual indexing relies on human judgment.

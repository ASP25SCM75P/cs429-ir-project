    <h1>Stemming</h1>
    
        In linguistic morphology and information retrieval, stemming is the process of reducing inflected words to 
        their word stem, base or root form. The stem need not be identical to the morphological root of the word; 
        it is usually sufficient that related words map to the same stem, even if this stem is not in itself a 
        valid root.
        
        A stemmer for English operating on the stem 'cat' should identify such strings as 'cats', 'catlike', and 
        'catty'. A stemming algorithm might also reduce the words 'fishing', 'fished', and 'fisher' to the stem 
        'fish'. The goal of stemming is to reduce different forms of a word to a common base form. The Porter 
        stemming algorithm is one of the most common stemming algorithms in use today.

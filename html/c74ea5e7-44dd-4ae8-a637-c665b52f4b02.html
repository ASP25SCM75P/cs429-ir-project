    <h1>Web Crawler</h1>
    
        A Web crawler, sometimes called a spider or spiderbot and often shortened to crawler, is an Internet 
        bot that systematically browses the World Wide Web and that is typically operated by search engines 
        for the purpose of Web indexing.
        
        Web search engines and some other websites use Web crawling or spidering software to update their 
        web content or indices of other sites' web content. Web crawlers copy pages for processing by a 
        search engine, which indexes the downloaded pages so that users can search more efficiently. Crawlers 
        consume resources on visited systems and often visit sites without approval.

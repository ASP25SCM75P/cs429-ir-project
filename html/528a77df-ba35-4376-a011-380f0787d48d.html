    <h1>TF-IDF</h1>
    
        In information retrieval, tf-idf or TFIDF, short for term frequency-inverse document frequency, 
        is a numerical statistic that is intended to reflect how important a word is to a document in a 
        collection or corpus. It is often used as a weighting factor in searches of information retrieval, 
        text mining, and user modeling.
        
        The tf-idf value increases proportionally to the number of times a word appears in the document 
        and is offset by the number of documents in the corpus that contain the word, which helps to 
        adjust for the fact that some words appear more frequently in general. tf-idf is one of the most 
        popular term-weighting schemes today.

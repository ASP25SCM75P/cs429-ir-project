    <h1>Collaborative Filtering</h1>
    
        Collaborative filtering is a method of making automatic predictions about the interests of a user by collecting 
        preferences or taste information from many users. The underlying assumption is that if person A has the same opinion 
        as person B on an issue, A is more likely to have B's opinion on a different issue than that of a randomly chosen person.
        
        While not strictly an information retrieval technique, collaborative filtering is closely related and is used in many 
        information access systems including recommender systems. Netflix, Amazon, and Spotify all use collaborative filtering 
        to recommend content. Methods include user-based collaborative filtering, item-based collaborative filtering, and 
        matrix factorization. Collaborative filtering can complement traditional IR techniques by personalizing search results 
        and recommendations based on the behavior of similar users.

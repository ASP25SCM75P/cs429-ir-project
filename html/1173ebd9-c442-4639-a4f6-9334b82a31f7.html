    <h1>Text Mining</h1>
    
        Text mining, also referred to as text data mining, similar to text analytics, is the process of deriving 
        high-quality information from text. It involves the discovery by computer of new, previously unknown 
        information, by automatically extracting information from different written resources.
        
        Text mining usually involves the process of structuring the input text, deriving patterns within the 
        structured data, and finally evaluation and interpretation of the output. High quality in text mining 
        usually refers to some combination of relevance, novelty, and interestingness. Typical text mining tasks 
        include text categorization, text clustering, concept extraction, sentiment analysis, document summarization, 
        and entity relation modeling.

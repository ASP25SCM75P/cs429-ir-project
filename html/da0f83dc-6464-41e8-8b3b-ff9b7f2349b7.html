    <h1>Semantic Search</h1>
    
        Semantic search denotes search with meaning, as distinguished from lexical search where the search engine looks for 
        literal matches of the query words or variants of them, without understanding the overall meaning of the query. 
        Semantic search seeks to improve search accuracy by understanding the searcher's intent and the contextual meaning 
        of terms.
        
        Semantic search systems consider various points including context of search, location, intent, variation of words, 
        synonyms, generalized and specialized queries, concept matching and natural language queries to provide relevant 
        search results. Technologies used in semantic search include knowledge graphs, natural language processing, machine 
        learning, and deep learning. Modern search engines increasingly incorporate semantic search capabilities.

    <h1>Click-Through Rate</h1>
    
        Click-through rate (CTR) is the ratio of users who click on a specific link to the number of total users who view a page, 
        email, or advertisement. In information retrieval, CTR is an important metric for evaluating search result quality and 
        can be used as implicit relevance feedback.
        
        Search engines analyze click-through data to improve ranking algorithms. If users frequently skip the top result to click 
        on a lower-ranked result, this signals that the ranking may need adjustment. CTR data is used in learning-to-rank systems 
        as a feature for training ranking models. However, CTR can be influenced by factors beyond relevance, such as snippet 
        quality and position bias. Position bias refers to the tendency of users to click on higher-ranked results regardless of 
        relevance. Accounting for these biases is important when using CTR data for improving search quality.

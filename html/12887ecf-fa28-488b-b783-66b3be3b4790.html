    <h1>Lucene</h1>
    
        Apache Lucene is a free and open-source search engine software library, originally written completely in 
        Java by Doug Cutting. It is supported by the Apache Software Foundation and is released under the Apache 
        Software License. Lucene is widely regarded as the de facto standard open-source search library.
        
        Lucene has been ported to other programming languages including C#, C++, Python, and Ruby. Lucene is used 
        by many applications including Twitter search, LinkedIn, Wikipedia search, and many others. It provides 
        a powerful query language, efficient indexing, and fast search capabilities. Lucene forms the core of 
        Elasticsearch and Apache Solr, two of the most popular enterprise search platforms.

    <h1>Information Seeking Behavior</h1>
    
        Information seeking behavior refers to the way people search for and utilize information. Understanding information seeking 
        behavior is important for designing effective information retrieval systems. Research has identified various information 
        seeking patterns and strategies that users employ when looking for information.
        
        Models of information seeking include Kuhlthau's information search process, Bates' berrypicking model, and Ellis' model of 
        information seeking behavior. Users may engage in exploratory search when their information need is unclear, or known-item 
        search when looking for a specific document. Search behavior often involves query reformulation, browsing, and navigating 
        through results. Modern IR systems aim to support various information seeking behaviors through features like query suggestions, 
        related searches, faceted navigation, and personalization. Understanding user behavior helps in designing better interfaces and 
        ranking algorithms.

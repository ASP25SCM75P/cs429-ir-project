    <h1>Boolean Retrieval</h1>
    
        Boolean retrieval is a model in information retrieval in which we can pose any query which is in 
        the form of a Boolean expression of terms, that is, in which terms are combined with the operators 
        AND, OR, and NOT. The model views each document as just a set of words.
        
        Boolean queries are a fundamental building block of information retrieval systems. They allow users 
        to combine search terms using logical operators. For example, the query 'information AND retrieval' 
        would return documents containing both terms. Boolean retrieval is precise but can be difficult for 
        users who are unfamiliar with Boolean logic.

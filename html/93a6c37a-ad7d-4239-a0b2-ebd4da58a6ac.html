    <h1>Social Search</h1>
    
        Social search refers to systems that incorporate social signals and relationships into search results and recommendations. These systems 
        leverage the collective intelligence of social networks to improve information discovery. The assumption is that information shared or 
        endorsed by trusted connections is more likely to be relevant and reliable.
        
        Social search features include incorporating likes, shares, and comments into ranking; showing results from friends' activities; and 
        enabling question-answering within social networks. Hash tags on social media platforms function as a distributed classification system. 
        Social bookmarking sites like Delicious pioneered social search concepts. Major search engines have experimented with social signals, 
        though privacy concerns and the risk of manipulation have limited their use. Social search can be particularly effective in niche communities 
        where members share specialized knowledge. The challenge is determining which social signals are truly indicative of quality and relevance.

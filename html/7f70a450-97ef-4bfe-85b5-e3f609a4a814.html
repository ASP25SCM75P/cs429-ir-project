    <h1>Snippet Generation</h1>
    
        A snippet is a brief summary or excerpt from a document that is displayed in search results. Snippet generation is an 
        important component of search engine results pages (SERPs) as it helps users quickly determine which results are most 
        relevant to their query without having to visit each page.
        
        Effective snippets typically highlight the query terms in context and show the most relevant portions of the document. 
        Techniques for snippet generation include extracting sentences containing query terms, using document abstracts or 
        metadata, and generating summaries using natural language processing. Query-biased summarization aims to create snippets 
        that specifically address the user's query. Rich snippets may include additional structured data like ratings, prices, 
        or images. The quality of snippets significantly affects click-through rates and user satisfaction.

    <h1>PageRank</h1>
    
        PageRank (PR) is an algorithm used by Google Search to rank web pages in their search engine results. 
        It is named after both the term 'web page' and co-founder Larry Page. PageRank is a way of measuring 
        the importance of website pages.
        
        PageRank works by counting the number and quality of links to a page to determine a rough estimate of 
        how important the website is. The underlying assumption is that more important websites are likely to 
        receive more links from other websites. Currently, PageRank is not the only algorithm used by Google 
        to order search results, but it is the first algorithm that was used by the company.

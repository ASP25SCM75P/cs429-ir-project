    <h1>Faceted Search</h1>
    
        Faceted search, also called faceted navigation or faceted browsing, is a technique for accessing information organized 
        according to a faceted classification system, allowing users to explore a collection of information by applying multiple 
        filters. A faceted classification system classifies each information element along multiple explicit dimensions.
        
        Faceted search is widely used in e-commerce websites and library catalogs. Users can progressively narrow down search 
        results by selecting from available facets. For example, when shopping for a laptop, facets might include price range, 
        brand, screen size, and processor type. Faceted search provides a powerful alternative to traditional keyword search, 
        especially when users are exploring a space rather than looking for a specific item. Implementation requires careful 
        design of the facet structure and efficient indexing for real-time filtering.

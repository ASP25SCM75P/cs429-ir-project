    <h1>Index Compression</h1>
    
        Index compression is crucial for large-scale information retrieval systems. Inverted indexes for web-scale collections 
        can be enormous, and compression techniques are essential for reducing storage costs and improving query processing speed 
        by allowing more of the index to fit in memory.
        
        Common compression techniques for inverted indexes include variable byte encoding, gamma codes, and delta encoding of 
        document IDs. Positional information is particularly expensive to store and benefits significantly from compression. 
        The trade-off between compression ratio and decompression speed must be carefully balanced. Modern search engines achieve 
        compression ratios of 10:1 or better while maintaining fast query processing. Compression is applied not only to posting 
        lists but also to the lexicon and document store.
